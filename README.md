# Bunkermaster's MultiProc package
MultiProc is a simple multi process management projet. The goal is to be able to start multiple parallel threads from PHP (7.1+) without having to install any extension. It is a crude, simplistic method of doing multithreading.  

***Warning : this is a pre-alpha and should NOT be used in production unless you really want things to go tits up.***
